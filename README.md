# The Floor is Lava!

> 21/07/2023

This was my very first independent project in Unity.

### Software Used

- Visual Studio Code 2023 (v1.85)
- Unity 2022.3.5f1 (LTS)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ManMetGames/the-floor-is-lava.git`
2.  Open the project in Unity
3.  Run the project

### Description

I completed this project as part of the Unity Essentials Pathway on Unity Learn. I wanted to get used to the editor ahead of starting my master's degree in games development, so I decided following the essentials pathway would be a good place to start.

All models were created using primitives. This project taught me:
- Some key shortcuts to use in the editor
- What a rigidbody is and how to use one
- How to import assets
- How to apply physic and graphic materials to models
- How to effectively use prefabs

The purpose of this project was more to have a play around with the editor, so don't expect much in terms of scripting :^)
